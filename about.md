I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island pursuing a bachelor's degree in cell and molecular biology. I am currently looking for opportunities to intern in a research laboratory. After graduation I intend to pursue a position as a laboratory technician and complete a master's degree in cell and molecular biology.

I have been fascinated with cell biology ever since high school, and this interest has expanded to include mammalian physiology, endocrinology, and metabolism. I have laboratory experience sequencing and editing viral genomes using recombinant DNA techniques, as well as working with gel electrophoresis, PCR, microscopy, cell culture, and data analysis.

I enjoy collaborating with others on creative projects at the intersection of art and science and was the Creative Director for the Science Outreach Society at Portland State University during the spring of 2017.
