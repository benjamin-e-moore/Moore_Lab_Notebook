#Science Communication

I believe in communicating the wonder of science through art and design. Using photography, computer modeling, physical set design, and online tutorials, the public can access scientific knowledge in a way that both informs and inspires. Science communication bridges the gap between common knowledge and technical concepts, paving the way to clear public dialogue about scientific ideas.
